I’m Liza, a software engineer based in Belarus.

I have 2 years of professional experience and a higher education in engineering.

If an idea comes to my mind, I’ll most likely dive into the required materials, learn what’s needed, and bring it to life.

My main tech stack includes Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and Spring. I also work with tools like Figma and Blender.

I enjoy building things, learning new technologies, and constantly improving my skills.

Fun Facts:

  - I have a favorite corgi dog 🐶

  - I love learning new things

  - Books are my passion

  - I enjoy sports
